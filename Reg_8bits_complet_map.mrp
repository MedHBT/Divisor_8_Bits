Design Summary
--------------
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    0

  Number of Slice LUTs:                         19 out of  12,480    1%
    Number used as logic:                       19 out of  12,480    1%
      Number using O6 output only:              18

  Number of occupied Slices:                     8 out of   3,120    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:           19
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            11 out of      19   57%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   0 out of      19    0%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:           8 out of      19   42%
    Number of unique control sets:               2
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               4 out of  12,480    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                        25 out of     172   14%

Specific Feature Utilization:
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      1 out of      32    3%
    Number used as BUFGs:                        1

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                4.45

Peak Memory Usage:  478 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  45 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   37 secs

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.
INFO:Pack:1716 - Initializing temperature to 85.000 Celsius. (default - Range:
   0.000 to 85.000 Celsius)
INFO:Pack:1720 - Initializing voltage to 0.950 Volts. (default - Range: 0.950 to
   1.050 Volts)
INFO:Map:215 - The Interim Design Summary has been generated in the MAP Report
   (.mrp).
INFO:Pack:1650 - Map created a placed design.

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
   9 block(s) optimized away
   9 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).

The signal "Reg8/D0/temp/VCC" is sourceless and has been removed.
The signal "Reg8/bcl[1].Di/temp/VCC" is sourceless and has been removed.
The signal "Reg8/bcl[2].Di/temp/VCC" is sourceless and has been removed.
The signal "Reg8/bcl[3].Di/temp/VCC" is sourceless and has been removed.
The signal "Reg8/bcl[4].Di/temp/VCC" is sourceless and has been removed.
The signal "Reg8/bcl[5].Di/temp/VCC" is sourceless and has been removed.
The signal "Reg8/bcl[6].Di/temp/VCC" is sourceless and has been removed.
The signal "Reg8/bcl[7].Di/temp/VCC" is sourceless and has been removed.

The trimmed logic reported below is either:
   1. part of a cycle
   2. part of disabled logic
   3. a side-effect of other trimmed logic

The signal "N0" is unused and has been removed.

Section 10 - Timing Report
--------------------------
A logic-level (pre-route) timing report can be generated by using Xilinx static
timing analysis tools, Timing Analyzer (GUI) or TRCE (command line), with the
mapped NCD and PCF files. Please note that this timing report will be generated
using estimated delay information. For accurate numbers, please generate a
timing report with the post Place and Route NCD file.

For more information about the Timing Analyzer, consult the Xilinx Timing
Analyzer Reference Manual; for more information about TRCE, consult the Xilinx
Command Line Tools User Guide "TRACE" chapter.
