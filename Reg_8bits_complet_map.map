Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    0
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                     8 out of  12,480    1%
    Number used as Flip Flops:                   8
  Number of Slice LUTs:                         19 out of  12,480    1%
    Number used as logic:                       19 out of  12,480    1%
      Number using O6 output only:              18
      Number using O5 and O6:                    1

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                     8 out of   3,120    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:           19
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            11 out of      19   57%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   0 out of      19    0%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:           8 out of      19   42%
    Number of unique control sets:               2
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               4 out of  12,480    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                        25 out of     172   14%

Specific Feature Utilization:
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      1 out of      32    3%
    Number used as BUFGs:                        1

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                4.45

Peak Memory Usage:  478 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  45 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   37 secs
