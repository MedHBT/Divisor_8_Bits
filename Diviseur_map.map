Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    0
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                    38 out of  12,480    1%
    Number used as Flip Flops:                  38
  Number of Slice LUTs:                         45 out of  12,480    1%
    Number used as logic:                       45 out of  12,480    1%
      Number using O6 output only:              45
  Number of route-thrus:                         5
    Number using O5 output only:                 5

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    18 out of   3,120    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:           48
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            10 out of      48   20%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   3 out of      48    6%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          35 out of      48   72%
    Number of unique control sets:               6
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              10 out of  12,480    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                        36 out of     172   20%

Specific Feature Utilization:
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      1 out of      32    3%
    Number used as BUFGs:                        1

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                3.41

Peak Memory Usage:  479 MB
