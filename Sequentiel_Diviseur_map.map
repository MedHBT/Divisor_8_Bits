Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    0
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                    27 out of  12,480    1%
    Number used as Flip Flops:                  27
  Number of Slice LUTs:                         67 out of  12,480    1%
    Number used as logic:                       67 out of  12,480    1%
      Number using O6 output only:              67
  Number of route-thrus:                         1
    Number using O5 output only:                 1

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    23 out of   3,120    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:           67
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            40 out of      67   59%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   0 out of      67    0%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          27 out of      67   40%
    Number of unique control sets:               6
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               9 out of  12,480    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                        97 out of     172   56%

Specific Feature Utilization:
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      4 out of      32   12%
    Number used as BUFGs:                        4

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                4.08

Peak Memory Usage:  478 MB
